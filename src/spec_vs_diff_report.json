  "summary": "The diff implements a new dark, game-like visual theme (CSS tokens + component classes), restyles the main AppLayout into a HUD, and redesigns several pages/components (Home, Tasks, Rewards, Settings, Avatar, Leaderboard, dialogs, TaskCard, reward overlay). However, the required generated image assets are not added in the diff, and not all listed main pages are shown as updated. There are also UI/logic additions that were not requested (e.g., sound/music toggles, synthetic/random reward construction, emojis in user-facing strings).",

      "requirement": "Apply the cohesive game-like theme consistently across all main pages and dialogs (Home, Tasks, Reminders, Rewards, Story, Avatar, Quests, Leaderboard, Insights, History, Settings).",
      "reason": "The diff shows updates for Home, Tasks, Rewards, Avatar, Leaderboard, Settings and some dialogs/components, but does not provide evidence that Reminders, Story, Quests, Insights, and History pages were updated to the new theme.",

      "reason": "The UI references multiple generated asset paths (logo mark, mascot, avatar stages), but the diff shows no added files under frontend/public/assets/generated and explicitly indicates 'ADDED FILES: none', so the required images are not evidenced as present.",
